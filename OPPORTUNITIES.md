DHH Code Review Feedback Summary

  The DHH code reviewer provided extensive feedback. Here are the key criticisms:

  Critical Issues Found:

  1. Method Too Long: The top_pending_tasks method is 118 lines (should be under 10-15 lines)
  2. Case Statement Code Smell: The 55-line case statement violates object-oriented principles - should use polymorphism instead
  3. N+1 Query Problem: The nested care_pathways.each with care_pathway_orders.where will cause performance issues
  4. Primitive Obsession: Building hash structures manually instead of using proper domain objects
  5. Duplicated Logic: Timer calculation logic is repeated throughout

  DHH's Recommendations:

  The reviewer suggests breaking the method into focused, single-responsibility classes:

  1. Extract a TaskCollector class to handle task collection logic
  2. Create a TaskTimer value object for timer calculations
  3. Use polymorphism instead of the case statement (e.g., TriageStep::CheckIn classes)
  4. Introduce proper domain objects like Task and Tasks collection
  5. Fix N+1 queries with proper includes and scopes

  What Works Well:

  - Method name is descriptive
  - Default parameter pattern is good
  - Final sorting logic is clean

  The reviewer provided a complete refactored version showing how DHH would structure this code with proper separation of concerns, but emphasized that these are
  recommendations, not requirements.
